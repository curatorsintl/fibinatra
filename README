A facebook app I'm developing in Sinatra with Sinbook and Rack

This is a proof of concept.  The output isn't very manageable now.  I will eventually add 
different filters and tabs for sorting through friends, managing their statuses, when people 
add or leave, and hopefully Facebook Connect.

GETTING STARTED
gem install sinbook
gem install sinatra

(no bundler yet).

start with the start bash from or however you want. (Uses Thin).

APACHE
When I run it with thin (per the start bash), I set the port to the default rack port.
In apache, I have in the virtual host

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName app.example.tld
    ServerAlias www.app.example.tld
    ProxyPass / http://app.example.tld:4567/
    #DocumentRoot /public/path/to/fibinatra/public (when I was trying to use passenger)
</VirtualHost>

so, I'm not actually using Passenger at this moment.
